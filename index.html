                    <h3>DIANA’S TRIPS</h3>
                    <p>Diana is a happy girl and she likes trips a lot. Her favorite city is Paris, she is in Paris every year for her birthday because she likes food there. She likes croissants and baguettes, but she doesn’t like soups.
                    Her friends in Paris are really fun and adventurous. They like hiking and canoeing. Those are very dangerous hobbies and they like them a lot. They don’t like boring sports such as baseball or swimming. Their weekends are really fun, so Diana likes to be with them.
                    Diana doesn’t like the way back. She is always sad at the end of the trip because her dream is to be with her friends every day.</p>
